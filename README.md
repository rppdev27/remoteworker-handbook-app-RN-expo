# Project Title

Remote Worker Handbook App - by Ryandev.site

This repository showcases my approach to developing a remote worker application, highlighting key features and functionalities. It serves as a boilerplate that you can fork or clone to adapt for your own remote work management needs.

## Intro

This project leverages various libraries for robust functionality:

   **Yup**: An object schema validation library.
   **React** Hook Form: A high-performance and adaptable form library for React.
   **React** Navigation: A comprehensive routing and navigation system for React Native.
   **Zustand**: Instead of using the React Context API, this project employs Zustand for efficient and scalable global state management.
   **React Query**: For effective server-side state handling.
   **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making data fetches to the server efficiently.

### UI Development

- **Custom UI**: This project does not use UI kits like NativeBase or similar libraries. All UI components are created manually.

- Node.js
- React Native CLI
- Yarn or npm
